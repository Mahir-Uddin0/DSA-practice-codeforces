You're given an array a of length n. For each index i such that 1≤i<n, you can perform the following operation at most once:

Assign ai:=ai⊕ai+1, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  
You can choose indices and perform the operations in any sequential order.

Given another array b of length n, determine if it is possible to transform a to b.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤10⁴). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2≤n≤2⋅10⁵).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai<2³⁰).

The third line of each test case contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (0≤bi<2³⁰).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10⁵.

## Output
For each test case, output "YES" (quotes excluded) if a can be transformed to b; otherwise, output "NO". You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

## Example

### Input
```
7
5
1 2 3 4 5
3 2 7 1 5
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
3
0 0 1
0 0 0
4
0 0 1 2
1 3 3 2
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
0 5 4 5 5 4
3
0 1 2
2 3 2
2
10 10
11 10
```

### Output
```
YES
NO
NO
NO
YES
NO
NO
```

### Note
In the first test case, you can perform the operations in the following order:

Choose index i=3 and assign a3:=a3⊕a4=7, and a becomes [1,2,7,4,5].  
Choose index i=4 and assign a4:=a4⊕a5=1, and a becomes [1,2,7,1,5].  
Choose index i=1 and assign a1:=a1⊕a2=3, and a becomes [3,2,7,1,5].
