# B. Pleasant Pairs

time limit per test 2 seconds  
memory limit per test 256 megabytes  

You are given an array a1,a2,…,an consisting of n distinct integers. Count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i < j and ai ⋅ aj = i + j.

## Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of array a.

The second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a1,a2,…,an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2⋅n) — the array a. It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

## Output

For each test case, output the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i < j and ai ⋅ aj = i + j.
